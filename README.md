## 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
In this step, we load the Udemy dataset and check for missing values to ensure the data is clean for further analysis.

--- 

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this section, we answer several key questions to gain insights into the dataset:

- What are the different subjects for which Udemy is offering courses?
- Which subject has the maximum number of courses?
- Which courses are free and which are paid?
- Top 5 most enrolled courses
- List courses related to Python
- What are the max number of subscribers per course level?

--- 

## 3. Data Visualization
In this section, we create visualizations to better understand the data:

- Distribution of courses by subject
- Free vs Paid course distribution
- Top 5 most subscribed courses
- Enrollment by course level


--- 

## 4. Conclusion
In this section, we summarize the findings from our analysis:

- Key insights from the distribution of courses, pricing, and subscribers
- Observations about the most popular subjects and course levels
- Understanding the free vs paid course distribution
